<h3><strong>What the hell is Fishbowl?</strong></h3>
<hr>
<div>
	<p style="margin-right: 60%;">Fishbowl points are a reward system implemented to incentivize people to attend WSEvents and interact with the community at large.
	You can earn them through attending Committee meetings, completing sub requests, tabling, completing extra CD reviews, among other things.
	Basically, the greater the number of Fishbowl points you have, the earlier priority you get when selecting a show slot for the semester.
	Keep in mind that the amount of semesters you have had with WSBF will also factor into show slot priority.
	</p>
	<p>Some reminders:</p>
		<li>Use the Fishbowl Log option in the sidebar to log items.</li>
		<li>Log any Commitee meetings, Events, or other activities you participated in.</li>
		<li>Always put a description</li>
		<li>Before you log the <strong>Other</strong> category, really consider if what you are about to put is <i>really</i> worth Fishbowl Points.</li>
		<li><strong>CD Reviews are logged automatically.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Filling a Sub Request is logged automatically.</strong></li>
