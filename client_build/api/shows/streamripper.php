/**
 * @file shows/streamripper.php
 *
 * This page is used by streamripper, which runs on "john" (130.127.17.39).
 * Streamripper is configured to pull this metadata with the script 
 * streamripper_start_on_boot.sh, which requests this every 10 seconds.
 * 
 * Streamripper uses the result from this to split and name the tracks.
 * The default behavior for streamripper is to name the track as <TITLE> - <ARTIST>.mp3.
 * We use the -D flag to set the name to only the title (-D %T). However, it appears that
 * streamripper uses the default configuration (name,artist).mp3 in the incomplete directory,
 * and then renames it as specified by the argument once the track is changed (i.e. new show).
